- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Andy6064
- ðŸ‘€ Hey there,

I'm just an individual looking for information about a specific algorithm. 
I've been trying to find some kind of software containing NLP that would help me find similarity between two or more texts by comprehending 
the meaning of sentences/paragraphs and matching these with the meaning of sentences/paragraphs in the other text or texts. 
For example, it would show similarities between two books, article, etc..

Another software I've been looking for is similar to the one explained above but understanding audio, its meaning and finding similarities 
with a different audio. For example, it would show similarities between two voice messages, podcasts or ted talks.

Any information would be helpful

Thank you in advance
